# ModularCounterProgram
This is a rebuilt and redesigned program I made to use while watching Twitch Streams.

# Details
The basic use of this program is you are able to add multiple counters and fill out different values for the counter itself.
You can change the Max Value, The Label, and the Id of each individual counter when you add it.

You are also able to make it so the window is always on top and uses the least amount of space required by the number of counters you have.

You are able to save the counters and load them as well so you are able to store them if you want.

This can be done while watching anything, or for other things as well.

# Design
This was created using Visual Studio 2017 on Windows.

I am a programmer, I am not good at making things look nice.
